## Rejection sampling

### Overview

Rejection is sampling is a computational strategy to sample from any arbitrary distribution. This proves useful especial for complex density functions that can't be calculated analytically. The idea of rejection sampling is to sample from a known proposal distribution g(x), apply an acceptance criterion and repeat until one arrives at a collection of accepted samples. For this short blog, we'll apply it to our previous joint distribution, which is slightly more tricky than a one dimensional case.


### Step 0: Finding M

The acceptance criterion for rejection sampling is defined as

$$
u < \frac{f(x, y)}{Mg(x, y)}.
$$

Here $f(x, y)$ is the distribution of interest, $g(x, y)$ is the proposal distribution and $M$ is a scalar value in $\mathbb{R}$ that is set a priori. The value $u$ is a single realization of the uniform distribution from 0 to 1, (e.g.  $U \sim Unif[0. 1]$). 

Before any simulations are run we have to find $M$. $M$ can be thought of as a scaling paramer to ensure $g(x, y)$ completely envelopes $f(x, y)$. More on this later. The general heuristic is to set 

$$
M = \sup_{D} \frac{f(x, y)}{g(x, y)}.
$$

This means $M$ should be set to the least upper bound for the likelihood ratio of $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$. Since we're working under the Bayesian framework, this is ratio of pdfs is considered a likelihood ratio because the data is observed, in other words fixed. 

As before we defined region D as 

$$
D = \{(x,y) \vert ~ 0 \leq x \leq 1, x^3 \leq y \leq \sqrt{x}  \}.
$$

There are many ways to find the supremum (e.g. derivatives, limits) but here we do it numerically by evaulating the ratio on a set of points within $D$. It is only an estimate because there are an infinite amount of real numbers contained with a fixed interval. 

~~~r
steps <- 0.01
likelihood_evaluations <- c()
xs <- c()
ys <- c()

for (x in seq(0, 1, steps)){
  for (y in seq(x^3, sqrt(x), steps)){
    likelihood_ratio <- f_xy(x, y) * (sqrt(x) - x^3)
    likelihood_evaluations <- c(likelihood_evaluations, likelihood_ratio)
    xs <- c(xs, x)
    ys <- c(ys, y)
  }
}

df <- data.frame(xs, ys, likelihood_evaluations)
df[which.max(df$likelihood_evaluations),]
~~~

Running the code above we find $M$ to be 2.47.

### Step 1: Selecting the Proposal Distribution

For rejection sampling to work we need the proposal distribution to envelope the entirety of the target distribution $f(x, y)$. This means the following condition must hold for all values $x$ and $y$:

$$
Mg(x, y) \geq f(x, y).
$$

This means that the support of $g(x, y)$ must include $f(x, y)$.


### Step 2: The Algorithm 

To code the algorithm we first define the target pdf.

~~~r
# Define the joint density function f(x, y)
f_xy <- function(x, y) {
  if (y >= x^3 && y <= sqrt(x)) {
    return(156 / 55 * (4 * x * y - y^3))
  } else {
    return(0)  # outside the domain
  }
}
~~~

Next we define the proposal distribution. For this case we use a uniform distribution over the region $D$, the pdf is

$$
g(x, y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x} - x^3}
$$

for $x \in [0, 1]$, and $y \in [x^3, \sqrt{x}]$.

Aside:

The pdf of a two dimensional uniform distribution is 

$$
f(x, y) = \frac{1}{(b-a)(d-c)}
$$

for $x \in [a, b]$ and $y \in [c, d]$ and 0 otherwise.

~~~r
g_xy <- function(x, y){
  return (1 / (sqrt(x) - x^3))
}
~~~

Now we're finally ready to apply the full algorithm.

~~~r
# Acceptance-Rejection Sampling
n_samples <- 100000  # Number of samples to generate
# Collect samples from f(x, y)
samples_x <- numeric(n_samples)
samples_y <- numeric(n_samples)

count <- 0
# set M to the value we found
M=2.47

while (count < n_samples) {
  
  # Sample x uniformly in [0, 1]
  x_candidate <- runif(1, 0, 1)
  # Sample y uniformly in [x^3, sqrt(x)]
  y_candidate <- runif(1, x_candidate^3, sqrt(x_candidate))
  
  # Sample u uniformly in [0, 1] for acceptance-rejection
  u <- runif(1, 0, 1)
  
  # Acceptance criterion
  if (u <= f_xy(x_candidate, y_candidate) / (M*g_xy(x_candidate, y_candidate))) {
    count <- count + 1
    samples_x[count] <- x_candidate
    samples_y[count] <- y_candidate
  }
}
~~~

To generate a candidate pair $(x, y)$ we sample uniformly from the support of the proposal distribution. We plug these values into the target pdf and the proposal pdf. We then compare the result to the value $u$, which is a single realization of a uniform random variable.

~~~r
plot(hexbin(samples_x, samples_y), 
     main = "Joint Density of X and Y", 
     xlab = "X", 
     ylab = "Y",
     colramp=colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(11, "Spectral")))
)
~~~

There we have it! It's our joint distribution, estimated via rejection sampling.
