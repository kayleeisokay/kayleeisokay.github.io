Hello! My name is Kaylee and I'm a first-year masters student at Harvard, studying Data Science. Before, I worked as a data scientist/software engineer in San Francisco and received my Bachelors of Arts in Economics at Stanford, where I was also a research fellow at the Center of Poverty and Inequality. 

In terms of academics, I love statistics, specifically causal inference and health economics. Machine learning is interesting too, a close second. 

Outside of academics, I'm a fan of all things Korea related like K-Dramas, K-Pop, fashion, makeup, and practicing Korean. Favorite drama is Queen of Tears and favorite group is BTS (Spring Day will never get old). I'm also an animal lover as such I frequent acquariums, zoos and own many plushies.

My hope for this blog is to document interesting concepts I've learned, sprinkled with posts about life. I hope it can be something I can look back on in the future.
